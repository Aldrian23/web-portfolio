        "I am a 23-year-old fourth-year student enrolled in Western Mindanao State University's BS Information Technology course. My fascination with IT began when I was an ICT student in senior high school. As I graduated, I was inspired to create websites and applications, which led me to pursue this course in college.",
        "When I'm not studying, I enjoy playing basketball, exploring the virtual world of online games like Dota and Valorant, and strumming the strings on my guitar. Coding is another passion of mine, as it allows me to express my creativity and unwind.",
        "After graduation, I aim to apply to a company surrounded by talented developers, where I can learn from the best and grow as a professional. My ultimate goal is to become a full-stack developer, and I'm excited to take the first steps towards achieving my dream.",
